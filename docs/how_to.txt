What does x mean?
    - One Hot Encoding:
        It refers to splitting the column which contains numerical categorical data
        to many columns depending on the number of categories present in that column.
        Each column contains “0” or “1” corresponding to which column it has been placed.

        Fruit | categorical value of fruit | price
        apple |      1                     | 5
        mango |      2                     | 10
        orange|      3                     | 15
        apple |      1                     | 20

        ->
        apple | mango | orange | price
        1     |   0   |    0   |   5
        0     |   1   |    0   |   10
        1     |   0   |    0   |   15
