What to make for model to work:
    (PointNet++
    - Files needed:
        - config.yaml
        - pointnet2.yaml
        - model/mypointnet2.py
        - module/pointnet2/dense.py
    - Files to use:
        - base_conv/dense.py
        - files from "core")

What does x mean?
    - One Hot Encoding:
        It refers to splitting the column which contains numerical categorical data
        to many columns depending on the number of categories present in that column.
        Each column contains “0” or “1” corresponding to which column it has been placed.

        Fruit | categorical value of fruit | price
        apple |      1                     | 5
        mango |      2                     | 10
        orange|      3                     | 15
        apple |      1                     | 20

        ->
        apple | mango | orange | price
        1     |   0   |    0   |   5
        0     |   1   |    0   |   10
        1     |   0   |    0   |   15
        0     |   0   |    1   |   20

    - Residual block:
        (SHORT: very deep networks are not able to learn simple functions, solution:
            - feed output of layer to not only next layer but all of them)
        https://towardsdatascience.com/residual-blocks-building-blocks-of-resnet-fd90ca15d6ec

    - Dilated Residual Block is used in RandLaNet and it is composed of MLPs, LocSEs,
      attentive poolings.

    - nn.Linear can be called for 3D - linear transform is applied only on the last dimension
        - [[10, 16, 32], [10, 32, 64]]
